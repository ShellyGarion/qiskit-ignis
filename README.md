**Qiskit** is an open-source framework for working with noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.

Qiskit is made up of elements that each work together to enable quantum computing. This element is **Ignis**, which provides tools for quantum hardware verification, noise characterization, and error correction.

## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit via the PIP tool (a python package manager), which installs all Qiskit elements, including this one.

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

PIP will handle all dependencies automatically for us and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst).

## Creating your first quantum experiment with Qiskit Ignis
Now that you have Qiskit Ignis installed, you can start creating experiments, to reveal information about the device quality. Here is a basic example:

```
$ python
```

```python
...
```
